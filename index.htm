<p style="text-align:center;">With this site I would like to talk about one of my favorite game series, Portal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Portal is a 2007 puzzle-platformer developed by VALVE, later they would go on to create Portal 2 which was released in 2011. I loved both Portal games growing up,
it was fun to go through all the puzzles and learn all the lore and secrets, the aesthetics and style of the game is also something that really pulled me in and have inspired me in my own work.</p>

<h2>The Game</h2>
<p> Portal is a puzzle-platformer where you play as a woman named Chell who awakes from stasis to find herself trapped in the Aperture Science facility, here you are tasked by the facilities AI, GLaDOS, with 
solving an array of test with the promise of cake and freedom at the end. Throughout the tests, you slowly learn the mechanics of the game by solving physics based puzzles and more specifically, how to use the Portal Gun with these puzzles.
 Pushing boxes onto buttons, avoiding turrets and other deadly situations, making portals in the correct places  to get around and successfully complete each puzzle. Each test becomes more difficult than the last as you and Chell 
both slowly learn that not everything is well in the facility and there is no prize nor freedom at the end of the testing chambers. Using everything learned from the tests, you must 
find a way to escape before GLaDOS finishes you off just as she did with the other test subjects.</p>

<h2>Narrative Arc</h2>  
<p>The exposition of Portal begins with you, as Chell, waking up in a relaxation vault from stasis inside the Aperture Science facility. After being welcomed and briefed by the AI of the facility, GLaDOS, you are tasked 
with completing a set of tests with the promise of cake at the end as well as a supposed freedom. Rising action starts as you make your way through each test, it becomes clear that something is quite wrong with the facility, devoid of any 
other humans and strange scribblings hidden behind walls reveal that GLaDOS is actually a major threat, a rogue AI with a deadly past. Once you finally complete the test, GLaDOS immediately tries to dispose of you by dumping you into an incinerator, but 
luckily with the help of the Portal Gun you can escape, no longer trapped by test chambers and free to roam in the inner workings of the facility. The climax of the story would be when you eventually make your way to GLaDOS' lair where you face down against 
her as she tries to kill you, during this fight, you must hit GLaDOS with all the rockets she sends your way and once you do, she will drop her personality cores. You must grab all the personality cores that fall from GLaDOS and throw them in the 
incinerator to destroy them and defeat GLaDOS.</p>
<h3>The Ending</h3>
<p>At the end, once GLaDOS is finally defeated, a strange portal seems to appear in the roof that pulls both you and GLaDOS in, then everything goes white. Once more you awake but now you find yourself outside in some parking lot above ground, not longer trapped in the facility and surrounded by all the wreckage and debris 
from your battle. Before you can even get up, a voice is heard and something slowly begins to drags you back right into the facility as the screen fades to black.</p>
