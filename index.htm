<h1 style="text-align:center;">PORTAL</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">With this site I would like to talk about one of my favorite game series, Portal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Portal is a 2007 puzzle-platformer developed by VALVE, later they would go on to create Portal 2 which was released in 2011. I loved both Portal games growing up,
it was fun to go through all the puzzles and learn all the lore and secrets, the aesthetics and style of the game is also something that really pulled me in and have inspired me in my own work.</p>
