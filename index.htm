<p style="text-align:center;">With this site I would like to talk about one of my favorite game series, Portal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Portal is a 2007 puzzle-platformer developed by VALVE, later they would go on to create Portal 2 which was released in 2011. I loved both Portal games growing up,
it was fun to go through all the puzzles and learn all the lore and secrets, the aesthetics and style of the game is also something that really pulled me in and have inspired me in my own work.</p>

<h2>The Game</h2>
<p> Portal is a puzzle-platformer where you play as a woman named Chell who awakes from stasis to find herself trapped in the Aperture Science facility, here you are tasked by the facilities AI, GLaDOS, with 
solving an array of test with the promise of cake and freedom at the end. Throughout the tests, you slowly learn the mechanics of the game by solving physics based puzzles and more specifically, how to use the Portal Gun with these puzzles.
 Pushing boxes onto buttons, avoiding turrets and other deadly situations, making portals in the correct places  to get around and successfully complete each puzzle. Each test becomes more difficult than the last as you and Chell 
both slowly learn that not everything is well in the facility and there is no prize nor freedom at the end of the testing chambers. Using everything learned from the tests, you must 
find a way to escape before GLaDOS finishes you off just as she did with the other test subjects.</p>

<h2>Narrative Arc</h2>  
<p>The exposition of Portal begins with you, as Chell, waking up in a relaxation vault from stasis inside the Aperture Science facility. After being welcomed and briefed by the AI of the facility, GLaDOS, you are tasked 
with completing a set of tests with the promise of cake at the end as well as a supposed freedom. Rising action starts as you make your way through each test, it becomes clear that something is quite wrong with the facility, devoid of any 
other humans and strange scribblings hidden behind walls reveal that GLaDOS is actually a major threat, a rogue AI with a deadly past.</p>
